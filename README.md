This is a Game of Thrones inspired Hangman game played using a CLI. The user has 10 guesses to guess the word, otherwise they lose. The program utilizes the colors node package to style the text in the CLI, and uses inquirer as the UI. There are two main object constructors: Letters and Word. The logic for the game play is found in hangman.js
